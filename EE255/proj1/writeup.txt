1. How does a system call execute? Explain the steps from making the call in the userspace process to returning from the call with a result.

A system call executes by first changing from user mode to kernel mode trough a system interrupt (trap). The function will then be handled in the kernel space before switching back to userspace.

2. When does access to data structures in userspace need to be synchronized?

When there is a shared resource that could be used by multiple processes.

3. What synchronization mechanisms can be used to access shared kernel data structures safely? List them.

Atomic Operations, Locking, and Mutexes

4. Can spinlocks be used on single-processor platforms? Why or why not?

No because since there is only a single thread that can be run at a time then sending a thread to a busy-wait loop would require more overhead than if there was just a simple lock in place.
